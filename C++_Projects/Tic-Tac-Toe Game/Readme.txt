The Program demonstrates the Tic-Tac-Toe Game.
The game consists of 2-dimentional array of size 3x3.

The game starts where each position on the array is marked with an asterisk (*), and then: 
  1. player1 can choose specific location, and that location will be marked by "X".
  2. then player2 can choose different location, and that location will be marked by "O".
  3. continue the game between the two players until one of the player wins or a tie occurs, and then the game ends.

The player who can achieve three symbols in a row is the winner player and the game end. The
three "X" or three "O" can be in a row, column, or diagonal across the board.
