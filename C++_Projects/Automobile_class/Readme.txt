       a. Make    // The make of Automobile
       b. Year model
       c. Mileage
       d. Price 
  2. Car – The first derived class, which has all the variables of Base class, and in addition, it has another variable: 
       a. Number of doors 
  3. Truck – The second derived class, which has all the variables of Base class, and in addition, it has another variable:
       a. Drive Type (two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive)
  4. SUV – The third derived class, which has all the variables of Base class, and in addition, it has another variable:
