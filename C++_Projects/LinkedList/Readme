This project creates linkedlist in Object Oriented Fashion. Here is the summary:

1.	The program creates a linkedlist called list1 and appends some values to the list.
2.	The program then inserts some other values to the linkedlist.
3.	The program creates another linkedlist called list2 which is identical copy of list1.
4.	The program then reverses the order of nodes in linkedlist list2.
5.	The program then displays one value from list1, and then one value of list2 (after being reversed) . This is basically to achieve the purpose of displaying one value from the beginning of list1, and then one value from the end of list1, and continues. 
6.	The program then deletes some values of list1.
